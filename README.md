This repository contains detailed manual test cases and bug reports for publicly available web applications. It is designed to showcase practical QA skills in test case design, bug documentation, and structured testing.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

To demonstrate:
- Proficiency in writing clear, reproducible manual test cases
- Structured bug reporting
- Analytical thinking and attention to detail
- QA documentation best practices

## ðŸ“‚ Projects
